# ROS_programs
The first program is in auv_pkg/src. Here I've used 4 nodes where there is connection between each pair.
The second program is in auv_pkg2/src. Here I've used 1 node and have tried to make a chatbot, where that node is subscribed to and publishing to the same topic. At each instance give a unique node_name.
